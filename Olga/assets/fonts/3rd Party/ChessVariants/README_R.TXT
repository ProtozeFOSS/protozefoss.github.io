                      TrueType Font: FigurineSymbol T

This font is useful for converting texts in standard algebraic  notation  to
figurine notation.  It is also useful for writing games  analyses  with  the
symbols for the Informant, NIC and USCF systems.  The font has  the  numbers
0 to 9, letters a to h, figurines and the symbols.

The font is made for creating texts in  Normal  and  Bold  characters. Three
versions are offered  for  converting  texts  of  different  languages  into
figurines:

   FigurineSymbol T1:  Croatian, Danish, English, German, Slavonic, Swedish,
                       and Yugoslavian.

   FigurineSymbol T2:  French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish.

   FigurineSymbol T3:  Dutch, Finnish, Hungarian, and Norwegian.


The files for each one of these versions are:

          FigurineSymbol T1:  FIG-TN-1.TTF    (Normal)
                              FIG-TB-1.TTF    (Bold)

          FigurineSymbol T2:  FIG-TN-2.TTF    (Normal)
                              FIG-TB-2.TTF    (Bold)

          FigurineSymbol T3:  FIG-TN-3.TTF    (Normal)
                              FIG-TB-3.TTF    (Bold)

The font is installed in Windows in the usual  way.  I  recommend  that  you
install the font set into your computer so that it adapts to  your language,
and then you open the  GUIDE_T1.DOC  file indicated for this  font  (T1,  T2
or T3). This file is made in the Word 6.0 program and  contains  the  map of
characters of the keyboard and the tables with the symbol's meaning.

The figurines of this font are a simple design from  my  CHESS MERIDA  font.
The font was created exclusively in Corel Draw 3.0, drawings  and  exporting
to TTF format.  I made the font in the  "Colegio La Salle de  San Cristobal"
(La Salle School of San Cristobal), located in the pleasant mountains of the
south of Mexico; in order to expand our collection of chess fonts. This font
is freeware, I hope it is useful for the  chess comunity.  If  you  want  to
repay us, you can send us some other chess  fonts  (we are collecting them).
Your comments and suggestions would be welcome; please send them  to  either
of address that appear below.
